Rabiul Awal is a CS M.Sc student at UofS. He works with Professor Michael Horsch and Roy Lee.
He is also a member of SocialAI.studio at SUTD. His current research focuses on social NLP problems (e.g. fairness) and
developing deep learning systems for low-resource languages and few-shot NLP tasks. He has explored multi-task learning,
meta-learning, and transfer learning approaches to improve knowledge transfer across domains and languages. He is broadly
interested in machine learning models that can learn, multi-task and adapt from small data.
