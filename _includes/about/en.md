I am a CS master's student at [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/). I work with Professor Michael Horsch and [Roy Ka-wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/home).
I am also a member of [SocialAI.Studio](https://www.socialai.studio/home) based at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).
Before moving to Canada, I worked at [Goava](https://www.goava.com/sv/), a B2B sales intelligence startup as a software engineer. I completed bachelor in Computer Science at [Noakhali Science and Technology University](https://nstu.edu.bd/) in Bangladesh in 2018. This site double as my personal blog. Posts range from computer science to my perspectives on life and absurdity. In my free hours, I like reading paperbacks, cooking, and blogging sometimes.


I am running a Dhaka-based reading group on NLP research started this summer [[course-page]](https://nlp-reading-group-dhaka.github.io/), an advance graduate-level reading course will continue for Fall 2021 season also [[webpage]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSPhi_N9BqxTrla-4Zpgvtx2pZt-ZH5gAIUi5pBA8gR40oG5Nqc4GExxJvwpp-x7UQoTQy9DlhQLL_P/pub).



### <span style="color:#990000">Research </span>

My current research focuses on social NLP problems and developing deep learning systems for low-resource languages and few-shot NLP tasks.
I am broadly interested in machine learning models that can learn, multi-task, and adapt from small data.
- **NLP for Social Good** - Cross-domain multilingual disinformation detection, cross-lingual meta-training for low-resource hate speech, commonsense reasoning and implicit hate speech detection.
- **Multilingual NLP**: Cross-lingual transfer. Efficient and flexible multi-task learning with multilingual pre-trained sentence encoders.
- **Transfer Learning & Meta-learning** - [Efficient transfer learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8dVzzGkKAJy06dUoESEQIqNJUFvkj5g/view?usp=sharing) and preventing negative transfer. Learning from small data [[slides]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qK06orhJ46KLbVI6KjlzMebwfqXQWL1B/view?usp=sharing) and fast adaptation on novel tasks.

‚òïüçïI work at **G60 lab** in the basement of [Thorvaldson Building](https://maps.usask.ca/?id=6c4f416580e9d24d564eb456e4599e85). If you are interested in deep learning or nlp, feel free to drop by during office hours.
