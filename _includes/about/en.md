I am a CS master's student at [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/). I work with Professor Michael Horsch and [Roy Ka-wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/home).
I am also a member of [SocialAI.Studio](https://www.socialai.studio/home) based at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).

I am running a Dhaka-based reading group on NLP research since summer21 [[website]](http://nlpdhaka.com/).



### <span style="color:#990000">Research </span>

My current research focuses developing deep learning systems for low-resource languages, specifically, building models and datasets for social value tasks in nlp.
My long term goal is studying compositionality and reasoning in langugage and out-of-distribution generalization in deep learning. 
- **NLP for Social Good** -- MUSCAT: Multilingual Rumor Verification in Social Media Conversations *(submitted to COLING22)*. Cross-lingual meta-training for low-resource hate speech *(submitted to KDD22)*. Joint learning target and emotion for hate speech detection *(PAKDD21)*. 
- **Efficient Transfer & Modular ML** -- Efficient and flexible multi-task learning with multilingual pre-trained sentence encoders *(in progress)*. [Efficient transfer learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8dVzzGkKAJy06dUoESEQIqNJUFvkj5g/view?usp=sharing) and preventing negative transfer. Learning from small data [[slides]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PoBuimWzSOmUhJA03RiuiYIUWcWKxqjj/view?usp=sharing) and modular fast adaptation on novel tasks. 
- **Out-of-distribution Generalization** - Handling distribution shift, adapting to changing environments. Domain Adaptation as a Problem of Inference on Graphical Models *([course project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/177MYwtcqfmvXTID-PMFHsdoN9K6ZJtbu/view?usp=sharing))*
