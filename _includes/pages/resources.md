<span style="color:#ff00d5; font-size:1.25em; "> [🌎 Global Equality for PhDs in NLP / AI] </span> One non-negligible reason for success is access to information, such as (1) knowing what a PhD in NLP is like, 
(2) knowing what top grad schools look for when reviewing PhD applications, 
(3) broadening your horizon of what is good work, (4) knowing how careers in NLP in both academia and industry are like, and many others.
Check this awesome github resource repository ([https://github.com/zhijing-jin/nlp-phd-global-equality](https://github.com/zhijing-jin/nlp-phd-global-equality)) with answers 
on many such questions. Thanks to **Zhijing Jin** for putting this together.

<span style="color:#FF0000; font-size:1.25em; "> [🍩 Telegram channel for job posts] </span> *I maintain a telegram channel [[link]](https://t.me/s/msphdprof) where 
I post tweets made by professors on MS+PhD open positions. I usually follow ML & AI people. 
Often recruitment ads come from these two areas mostly.
You may use this job posting with proper care for instance writing a personalized email while contacting profs.*

<span style="color:#0000FF; font-size:1.25em; "> [🧰 Tools for CS research] </span> Undergrads who are getting started with research often get stuck because they are unfamiliar with various tools. 
Here is a pointer to a very useful MIT course: [https://missing.csail.mit.edu](https://missing.csail.mit.edu).
This [blog post](https://kentonmurray.com/blogs/hackingphd.html) might also be relevant.

<span style="color:#6B8E23; font-size:1.25em; "> [📚 Reading groups] </span> I should mention communities that provide opportunities for ML research beyond university/industry research labs. 
You can join reading groups to follow discussion on  state-of-the-art AI research and get feedback on your research. 
Reading groups could possibly be a starting point for your first collaboration.
MLC, MILA, Stanford NLP Seminar are a few of them. Such a list can be found [here](#research-reading-groups).
