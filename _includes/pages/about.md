I am a research intern at [Mila, Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/). I am affiliated with MAIR lab, supervised by professor [Aishwarya Agrawal](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~agrawal/). I completed my masters at [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.cs.usask.ca/). During that period, I also worked at [SocialAI.Studio](https://www.socialai.studio/home) at Singapore University of Technology and Design supervided by professor [Roy Ka-Wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/). Prior to moving to Canada,I was a software engineer at a Nordic [startup](https://www.goava.com/sv/) with 2 years of experience in Python, Pytorch, NoSQL, microservices, and AWS. I completed my bachelor in Computer Scienece at [Noakhali Science and Technology Universiy](https://nstu.edu.bd/). 

My research interests are in language+vision AI, compositionality and representation learning, Social NLP. I have published 3 papers in conference venues. I run a reading group on NLP research out of [Dhaka](http://nlpdhaka.com/).


## Research
My current research goal is studying compositionality and reasoning in deep language+vision and out-of-distribution generalization in neural networks.

### Language + Vision
 The goal of this project is to systematically evaluate the generalization of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. I aim to achieve this through (1) investigating the reasoning skills of state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained vision-language Transformers and (2) systematic probing of VLMs for compositionality.

### NLP for Social Good
 My early research focuses on deep learning applications for tackling two social value tasks: online misinformation and hate speech in multiple languages.

## Blog
I occasionally write on how-to-cs-grad, coding, ai research, and systematic failure in Bangladesh.
