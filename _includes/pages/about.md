I'm a CS masters student & research assistant @ the University of Saskatchewan. I also work with [SocialAI.Studio](https://www.socialai.studio/home) @ SUTD. My research interests are in multilingual NLP, language+vision AI, and transfer learning. I have published 3 papers in conference venues. 

Before moving to Canada, I was a software engineer at a Nordic [startup](https://www.goava.com/sv/) with 2 years of experience in Python, Pytorch, NoSQL, microservices, and AWS. I run a reading group on NLP research out of [Dhaka](http://nlpdhaka.com/).

## Research
My current research goal is studying compositionality and reasoning in deep language+vision and out-of-distribution generalization in neural networks.

#### Language + Vision
 The goal of this project is to systematically evaluate the generalization of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. I aim to achieve this through (1) investigating the reasoning skills of state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained vision-language Transformers and (2) systematic probing of VLMs for compositionality.

#### NLP for Social Good
 My early research focuses on deep learning applications for tackling two social value tasks: online misinformation and hate speech in multiple languages. I have also explored efficient transfer learning and OOD generalization in language tasks { [Notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8dVzzGkKAJy06dUoESEQIqNJUFvkj5g/view?usp=sharing) / [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PoBuimWzSOmUhJA03RiuiYIUWcWKxqjj/view?usp=sharing) / [project report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/177MYwtcqfmvXTID-PMFHsdoN9K6ZJtbu/view?usp=sharing) }.
